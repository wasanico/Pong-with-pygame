# Pong-with-pygame


##How to play:

press space to first launch the ball
use up and down keys to move the left racket

##More info:

Still not optimized and clear code
Dumb AI, to improve I should use trigonometry and calculate where the ball will go
Still have some issues with hitbox
Should use more angles for the launch of the ball (between -60 and +60 deg; 120 and 240 deg)
